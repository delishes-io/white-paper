## Road map

The road map consists of 4 phases in chronological order to tackle the initial cold start problem and achieve progressive decentralization[^5] thereafter, viz. Cold start, Centralized Platform Launch, Decentralization of the Product and Decentralization of the Governance

### Phase 1: Cold Start

Initially, the company will build a centralized food discovery app to capture the demand while gradually integrating more functionalities.
 
 - Build an app recommending delishes (delicious dishes) on a weekly/daily basis with curated content selected by us.

 - Implement the crypto incentives which encourage early sign-ups and usage of the app

 - Add the functionality for content creators and onboard content creators like food influencers while converting existing customers to content creators (post food pictures and write reviews).

 - Scale the network while learning from customer interactions using data.
 
 ### Phase 2: Centralized Platform Launch

The *founding team* will 

- raise capital from investors through equity financing by reserving governance tokens;
 
- recruit talent by direct compensation and indirect reserved governance token offering;

- build a centralized platform with the decentralization in mind focused on product / market fit and network effects;

  When building software applications, it is desirable to achieve the fine balance between the quality, speed and decentralization. In general speed > quality > decentralization, but building a decentralized application with decent quality and running it in a centralized manner in the beginning will benefit the company in the long run. This applies to the operation and management of the company as well.

- launch food pickup platform in select cities (e.g. Toronto) and beta test the platform;

- build a community of the restaurants, consumers and drivers;

- at the end of the phase, run a private fundraising from the participants of the platform who are given the option to purchase the governance tokens based on their revenue contribution to the platform.
  
### Phase 3: Decentralization of the Product 

The *founding team* will

- optionally run additional rounds of private fundraising when needed;

- build and launch the fully decentralized platform and put governance tokens in circulation;

- coordinate an Initial Public Token offering;

- invite members to participate in the governance of the organization;
  
- launch delivery service and test profit model such as a fixed commission fee;
  
- grow the community to a global audience;

- scale the platform to serve the global audience.
  
### Phase 4: Decentralization of the Governance

  The *founding team* will progressively hand over the power to the governing body of the organization leading to an eventual disbandment of the *founding team*. Thereafter, the first *election* will be run to elect the *president* of the organization who will then be bestowed the power on the *executive*.
