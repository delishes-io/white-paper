## Business Model

### Token Incentives

A governance token will be used to govern the Delishes platform. By staking tokens, stakeholders will be allowed to propose and vote on key platform ownership decisions. This governance token will not be used as a method of payment for transactions on the platform, instead, payments will be done through stable coins or any other accepted cryptocurrencies. 

To reward early restaurant participants, restaurant partners will be airdropped tokens and given the option to purchase additional tokens prior to the Initial Public Token Offering (IPTO) based on their total revenue contribution to the platform. For customers, they will be able to earn governance tokens on every purchase they make through the platform. These governance tokens can be exchanged or staked to participate in platform ownership decisions. 


### Platform Features

Initially, the primary function of the platform for customers will be food discovery by dishes, as recommended based on a customerâ€™s eating profile and preferences. Over the long term, additional platform features will be released including pick-up ordering, delivery ordering, dine-in reservations, loyalty programs, and other restaurant marketing features. The release of these features will be determined by the community through feedback and proposals to the executive. 


### Utility-Based Service Fees

The standard service fee for restaurants and customers to participate on the platform is 0%. A small service fee will only be charged to restaurants looking for additional utilities beyond the basic platform functionalities. For example, a restaurant can opt into additional features such as advertising to new customers on the platform. 

A decentralized food ordering platform is able to offer a lower fee alternative for restaurants because unlike a centralized platform which aims to generate the highest ROI for investors, the purpose of a service fee is solely to maintain the baseline operational functions and any future improvements for the platform. Additionally, the operational cost of the platform is largely reduced compared to a centralized platform because of increased automation in business functions and lower marketing spending. Traditional marketing spending will be replaced by the token incentive, which is designed to encourage platform usage through ownership and incentives.
