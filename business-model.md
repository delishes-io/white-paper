### Lower Service Fees

In comparison to traditional third party delivery platforms, which on average collect 10% for pickup and 20-30% delivery service fee per order, decentralized food delivery offers a lower fee alternative for both restaurants and customers. This is possible because unlike other food delivery companies solely aiming high ROI for investors, with our participants also being the stakeholders by the nature of decentralization, the profit of the platform circles back to making the platform better. The operational cost of the organization is also largely reduced as a result of increased automation in business functions and lower marketing spending since participants essentially become the owners as they use the platform. With lower service fees, restaurants are prohibited to inflate menu prices from dine-in prices. 

### Token Incentives
Early adopters of the platform will receive governance tokens as they use the platform and with the governance tokens stakeholders will be able to share the platform's profits in Phase 2 and beyond from the value of the tokens.

#### Phase 1

- Incentives for Restaurants
  
  There will be no service fees charged from the restaurants or the consumers for any orders placed during *Phase 1*. Additionally, every restaurant will be given the option to purchase tokens starting at the private fundraising event at the end of *Phase 1* and prior to the Initial Public Token Offering (IPTO). The amount of tokens available for purchase will be granted in proportion to the restaurant’s total revenue contribution on the platform. 

- Incentives for Customers
  
  To reward early customers on the platform, these customers will be given the option to purchase tokens prior to the Initial Public Token Offering (IPTO). The amount of tokens available for purchase will be granted in proportion to the customer’s contribution (ie. amount spent) to the platform's revenue.

#### Phase 2 & Beyond

The platform will issue its own stable coins backed by governance tokens so that menu prices on the platform remain pegged to the equivalent fiat value to avoid price fluctuations for both customers and restaurants. 
During this phase, service fees for restaurants (currently set at 5% for pick-up) will come into effect. 
All service fees collected will be used for the operations of the platform, as determined by the executive led by the president of the organization who will be elected by the participants of the platform.
